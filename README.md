# Gimbals
## System description
This program simulate rotation movements through a set of three gibals connected, the inner, the middle and the outer gimbal. Gimbals are like frames that can rotate idependently. The inner gimbal may represent any object rotating in three dimentions, such as a car, a rocket, an airplane, a sattelite or even a hand. The composition of three independet rotations can reach any orientation in space.
